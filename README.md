# Functionality & Concepts used:
The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the users to add, delete and update transaction records. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

# Relative Layout:
We have used relative layouts to make our application, in addition to that we have added scroll view over it on different fragments which would allow the users to scroll if the contents overflow the viewport.

# Easy Design with Material Guidelines:
The TrackBucks application comprises of easy and simple widgets under Material Design Guidelines.

We have used Recycler Views to display all the transaction records in the All Transactions screen and show the top 3 recent transactions on the Dashboard screen.

The application is using Live Data to track all the transactions that are recently added, deleted and updated from the room database.

# Shared Preferences:
We have used shared preferences to keep track of theme and currency changes as the user demands.

# Jetpack Navigation Component with Bottom Navigation Menu:
We have used a fragement architecture where Bottom Navigation menu is used along with the Navigation component to navigate through different screens of the app.
