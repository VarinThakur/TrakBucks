# TrackBucks ðŸ’°
An android application which will help you to keep a track of your daily logs of transactions.

# Problem Statement:
It is common to spend or receive money from someone and forget what the transaction was about. Moreover logging your transactions is the best way to track your income and expenditure in order to ensure budget management and savings.

# Problem Solution:
A captivating android application that lets you record the date, time amount of your transactions along with the ability to add photos, update transaction records, delete unwanted records, change the theme of the app, and see the summary on the first screen of the app.

# Functionality & Concepts used:
The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the users to add, delete and update transaction records. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

# Relative Layout:
We have used relative layouts to make our application, in addition to that we have added scroll view over it on different fragments which would allow the users to scroll if the contents overflow the viewport.

# Easy Design with Material Guidelines:
The TrackBucks application comprises of easy and simple widgets under Material Design Guidelines.

# RecyclerView:
We have used Recycler Views to display all the transaction records in the All Transactions screen and show the top 3 recent transactions on the Dashboard screen.

# LiveData & Room Database:
The application is using Live Data to track all the transactions that are recently added, deleted and updated from the room database.

# Shared Preferences:
We have used shared preferences to keep track of theme and currency changes as the user demands.

# Jetpack Navigation Component with Bottom Navigation Menu:
We have used a fragement architecture where Bottom Navigation menu is used along with the Navigation component to navigate through different screens of the app.

# MVVM Architecture:
